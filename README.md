# CD Demo

This tiny demo app allows a user to manage and search cd data through a web service.

## Setup

To run this app, you need to have two instances running, one for the ui and one for the web service. The app is configured to have the web service instance running on localhost port 4000. You can modify this setting in `app/controllers/services/api_controller.rb`
